# tidy_data_project

## Week 4 Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data. 

This repository contains the necessary scripts and CodeBook for the analysis required in `Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project` from Coursera. 

This repo includes:
- `output.txt`, the final .txt outputted tidy set 
- `run_analysis.R`, the script required to reproduce the final tidy set
- `codebook.md`, a guide to understanding the data

The code itself is heavily commented and broken down into individual steps for readability.
